# Big Eyes Unique Investors Script

Simple, quick and dirty script that shows you how many unique investors there are in the
Big Eyes presale.

Unique investor = unique wallet address that has sent a supported currency (BNB bep-20, ETH erc-20
and USDT erc-20) to any of our presale wallets.

To run the script and see how many unique wallets there are first fill out the `.env` file
following the example from `.env.example`

`docker compose up`

And wait...
